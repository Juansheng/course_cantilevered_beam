Cantileverd Beam
================

## Model
TODO

## Course Objectives
* introduce Octave/Matlab world to undergraduate students
* learn how to build structural dynamic equations for a model
* realize FEM discretization and matrix assembly
* call eig() to compute the generalized eigen values/vectors
* understand the whole solving process of a normal ODE using lsode()

## Program Can
* dynamically re-discrete the beam
* compute the natural frequencies of the beam
* show one specified modal shape
* give the dynamic response of the beam under specific loads
